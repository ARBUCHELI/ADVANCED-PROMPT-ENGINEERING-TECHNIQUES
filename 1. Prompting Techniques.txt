# 1. Prompting Techniques
-------------------------

* Reference prompting
---------------------
When we prompt, we are sending off requests to a data model that puts together things that look like sentences and words.  Better talk to the system in English.

The proof these systems like ChatGPT are not really intelligent is they are not capable to complete taks like the following task:

	. Spell the word lollipop backwards.

	. The only way to do it is telling the system that split the word first into separated letters.

REFERENCE PROMPTING IS ABOUT GIVING CONTEXT TO THE PROMPT.

It means, you are giving the system reference material to work with.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Zero-shot and few-shot prompting
----------------------------------
In general better reference materials provide better outputs.

The reference to shot is related to how many examples you provide.

	. zero-shot prompt: No examples

	. few-shot prompt: You give a patter of some examples of prompts and responses. --> THE POINT HERE IS THE FINAL ANSWER IS GENERATED BASED ON THE PATTERN, AND TO GUIDE TO SYSTEM
											    TO MATCH THE PARENTS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
----------------------------------
We can provide the system a chain of thoughts for training it on how to answer the questions.

You train the system to match the patterns of the type of solutions you want.

You can order the ChatGPT to think step by step to solve specific problems.

PAY ATTENTION TO THIS:
______________________
WHEN YOU TELL THE SYSTEM TO THINK STEP BY STEP:

- THE SYSTEM CREATES ITS OWN PROCESS AND GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS STEP BY STEP.
- THIS ENDED UP BEING ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PROMPT ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES THAT EXIST.

IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE ANSWERS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, WHEN YOU ARE USING A AI SYSTEM, TRY THIS TECHNIQUE:

	. JUST TELL THE SYSTEM LET'S DO THIS STEP BY STEP AND SEE WHAT IT DOES.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Take a deep breath and work step by step
------------------------------------------
You can improve the output to tell the system:

TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND WORK STEP BY STEP. --> WHEN WE DO THIS, WE ARE INVOKING PATTERNS IN THE TRAINING MATERIAL.

If you prefix your request with TAKE A DEEP BREATH, it goes through a more in deep process every time, and its more likely to produce the right output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Generated knowledge prompting
-------------------------------
HOW DO WE CREATED EXAMPLES FOR THE PREVIOUS TECHNIQUES?

I can get the AI system to gereate these examples for me:

I can start giving a short list of examples, and when I get the response, I can use the response to continue working.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Tree-of-thought (ToT) prompting --> THIS IS VERY USEFUL FOR SOLVING COMPLEX TASKS.
---------------------------------
The previously studied techniques are linear.

AI systems can do a process of thinking that humans really cant.

EXPLANATION OF THE PROCESS
--------------------------
Imagine that you have a task, and instead of trying to solve it yourself, you have a group of experts, and for each step you ask each one of them what is the best step to move forward.

You leverage the AI system to come out with multiple solutions to solve a problem, at a time, and then you are having the system to pick which solution is the best one.

EXAMPLE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROCESS:
-----------------------------------------
1) Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
2) All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then sare it with the group.
3) Then all experts will go on to the next step. etc.
4) If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
5) The question is:
6) HERE YOU PROVIDE THE QUESTION.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Directional stimulus prompting
--------------------------------
GIVING THE AI A HINT OF WHAT YOU WANT --> IN THIS TECHNIQUE BASICALLY YOU ARE APPLYING COMMON SENSE (I'M EXPERT IN USING THIS TECHNIQUE).

EXAMPLE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNIQUE:
-------------------------------------------
1) Summarize the above in 2 -3 sentences based on the hint.
Hint: --> HERE WE PROVIDE THE HINT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Chain-of-density (CoD) prompting
----------------------------------
THIS TAKES ALL THE PREVIOUS TECHNIQUES AND STICK THEM UP TOGETHER INTO ONE GIANT PROMPT, THAT DOES SOMETHING THAT QUITE FRANKLY IS AMAZING.

WITH THIS TECHNIQUE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN GET JSON OUTPUT THAT YOU CAN USE IN AN APPLICATION.  

For example if you are building a summarization tool, for academic work.
