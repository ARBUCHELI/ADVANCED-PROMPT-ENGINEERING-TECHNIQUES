# 1. Prompting Techniques
-------------------------

* Reference prompting
---------------------
When we prompt, we are sending off requests to a data model that puts together things that look like sentences and words.  Better talk to the system in English.

The proof these systems like ChatGPT are not really intelligent is they are not capable to complete taks like the following task:

	. Spell the word lollipop backwards.

	. The only way to do it is telling the system that split the word first into separated letters.

REFERENCE PROMPTING IS ABOUT GIVING CONTEXT TO THE PROMPT.

It means, you are giving the system reference material to work with.
